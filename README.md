# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tainara, and I'm Brazilian. However, since the end of 2020, I've been living in Berlin, Germany.

When I embarked on this journey, I not only changed my address but also decided to change my career path. I hold a degree in Business Administration, where I had the first opportunities to witness how technology deeply permeates people's lives and day-to-day business operations. Intrigued by the profound impact of technology, my curiosity for the world of programming was aroused, prompting me to take the first step into this new universe.

I am a curious, connected, and multidisciplinary person, deeply concerned about my footprint on the world and constantly striving for improvement. I seek challenging opportunities where I can make a positive impact on the world.

As a self-learner, I have primarily focused on mastering **Python**  during this time. Exploring its complexities, I've dived into frameworks like **Flask**, **Django**, and **FastAPI**, gaining insights and hands-on experience in web development. Additionally, I've acquired proficiency in fundamental tools such as **HTML**, **CSS**, **Git**, and **Docker**, laying a solid foundation for my journey in creating engaging digital experiences.

So far my skills include:
